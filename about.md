Mainly to share my thoughts and document the practices that have helped/hindered me along the way and while this site is very much a work in progress, I hope to iteratively add more useful content.

## Features

* What not to do when programming in academic environment...
* Best agile practices
* Best software development practices
* TDD approach to learning new features to any programming language
* Being able to view my phd results as animations
* Description of my PhD


## I was inspired and helped by...

my colleague [John Nye][8] to build this website. Thank you for breaking the mental barriers I had around creating a blog.
Also for kicking me off with Jekyll.
